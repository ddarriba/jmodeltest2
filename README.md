# jmodeltest2

jModelTest is a tool to carry out statistical selection of best-fit models of nucleotide substitution. It implements five different model selection strategies: hierarchical and dynamical likelihood ratio tests (hLRT and dLRT), Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC), and a decision theory method (DT). It also provides estimates of model selection uncertainty, parameter importances and model-averaged parameter estimates, including model-averaged tree topologies. jModelTest 2 includes High Performance Computing (HPC) capabilities and additional features like new strategies for tree optimization, model-averaged phylogenetic trees (both topology and branch length), heuristic filtering and automatic logging of user activity.
