\section{Overview}

jModelTest is a tool to carry out statistical selection of best-fit models of nucleotide substitution. It implements five different model selection strategies: hierarchical and dynamical likelihood ratio tests (hLRT and dLRT), Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC), and a decision theory method (DT). It also provides estimates of model selection uncertainty, parameter importances and model-averaged parameter estimates, including model-averaged tree topologies. jModelTest 2 includes High Performance Computing (HPC) capabilities and additional features like new strategies for tree optimization, model-averaged phylogenetic trees (both topology and branch length), heuristic filtering and automatic logging of user activity.

In 2020, jModelTest was superseded by ModelTest-NG, available at \url{https://github.com/ddarriba/modeltest}.

\section{Graphical User Interface}
\label{sec:gui}

\subsection{Launching the Graphical User Interface}

The main distribution includes a script for launching the interface,  \emph{runjmodeltest-gui.sh}, located under the jModelTest home folder. Other possibility is running the following command line:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ java -jar jModelTest.jar
\end{lstlisting}

Moreover, in Windows and MacOS X, it is often possible to double-click the jModelTest.jar file to launch the graphical interface.

The following window will show on the screen:

\section{Common Use Cases}

\subsection{Converting Alignment Files}

jModelTest accepts several input alignment file formats. However, it makes use of the ALTER library for converting them into PHYLIP format, accepted by PhyML. If you want to validate your alignment, you can convert it into PHYLIP format using the ``-getPhylip'' argument. It will generate a new file appending ``.phy'' to the input alignment filename, and exit afterwards.

\begin{lstlisting}
$ java -jar jModelTest -d example-data/aP6.fas -getPhylip
\end{lstlisting}

In case there is something wrong in the input file, it will exit with the description of the error.

\subsection{Basic Model Selection}

Although jModelTest has many options, most of the users would like to perform a model selection among the 11 substitution schemes, including models with unequal frequencies, gamma rate variation and a proportion of invariable sites. The following command produces this operation, shows the selection results under the 4 available criteria, computes the model-averaged phylogenies (``-a''), computes the parameters importance (``-v'' and ``-p'') and writes the PAUP* block for the best-fit models (``-w''):

\begin{lstlisting}
$ java -jar jModelTest -d example-data/aP6.fas -s 11 -f -i -g 4 -AIC -BIC -AICc -DT -p -a -w
\end{lstlisting}

Note that, by default, jModelTest uses Maximum-Likelihood topologies as the base trees for the model optimization, and checks both NNI and SPR algorithms for the topology search. This obtains the most accurate results, but it is also the most time consuming operation. According to the size of the input alignment, one can directly select one of the algorithms saving time in the computations. As a general rule, for a small number of taxa NNI algorithm would work better, as well as SPR is more suitable for a large number of taxa. The tree search operation can be set with ``-S'' argument (e.g., -t ML -S NNI).

\subsection{Loading Checkpointing Files}
\label{sec:ckp}

By default, jModelTest saves ``.ckp'' checkpointing files in the log directory. In case of an error occurs, the user can start again the process minimizing the loss of computation. The user is in charge of selecting the checkpointing file and running again jModelTest with the same parameters of the previous execution. Otherwise the results might be wrong.

For finding the correct checkpointing file, if the execution had a user-defined name ``-n argument'', the checkpoing file will have the following format: 

\begin{lstlisting}
log/[sequenceFileName].[executionName].ckp
\end{lstlisting}

For example, the following command:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ java -jar jModelTest -d example-data/aP6.fas -n myTest -s 11 -f -i -g 4 -BIC -AIC
\end{lstlisting}

Will generate the checkpointing file in \$JMODELTEST\_HOME/log/aP6.fas.myTest.ckp, and in case of a sudden error in the execution, it can be continued using:

\begin{lstlisting}
$ java -jar jModelTest -d example-data/aP6.fas -n myTest -s 11 -f -i -g 4 -BIC -AIC -ckp log/aP6.fas.myTest.ckp
\end{lstlisting}

If no execution name was provided, it is automatically generated according to the current date and time with the following format: yyyyMMddhhmmss (e.g., if current time is 17:05:00 August 3 2014, the execution name is 20140803170500, and the checkpointing generated file is:

\begin{lstlisting}
log/[sequenceFileName].20140803170500.ckp).
\end{lstlisting}

When using the GUI instead of the command console interface, the checkpointing file can be loaded using the menu item ``File/Load checkpoint file'', that becomes enabled right after loading the alignment.

% \subsection{Finding the Best-fit Model for MrBayes Analysis}

% One common question is how to set the best-fit model obtained with jModelTest into MrBayes. The 3 substitution schemes option covers those models implemented in MrBayes. From the command console, the 3 substitution schemes mode is selected by default, so just make sure you are not modifying it with the ``-s'' argument.

From the GUI, one can choose between the different number of the substituion schemes in the execution settings window.
